# http-sucks-chat
Chat system developed for CS 262 to demonstrate that HTTP sucks. We are handcrafting a random wire protocol to substitute HTTP. And it should be better.

# TO-DOs

* Add database structure, mainly in chat_server.py
* Add some extra functionality to RESTServer (users_in_groups, user_exists)
* Add more design consideration into RDTP. It really needs improvement...
* Raise errors accordingly in chat_server.py, if group does not exist, etc.
* Check why fetch breaks RDTP
* Some nice-looking interface?
